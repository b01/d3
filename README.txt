Yes this is yet another Diablo 3 damage calculator. I am currently not satisfied with the existing D3 calculators out there as of 10/27/2012. Even though I feel that I'm almost done with the game, I feel even stronger the need to make this web-app; so it can help make it easier to select new weapons and armor. Plus I got REALLY excited about being able to access raw Diablo 3 data through an official BatttleNet Web API. Since I have a lot of experience with web development and coding around APIs, this should be a breeze for me. So I feel I must do this, tis my duty. :)
